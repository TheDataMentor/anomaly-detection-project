    "Based on our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We successfully identified several anomalies in our synthetic dataset using ARIMA forecasting residuals.\n",
    "2. The detected anomalies represent significant deviations from the expected values, which could indicate important events or issues in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "3. The distribution of residuals is approximately normal, with the detected anomalies appearing as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps for improving and applying this analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fine-tune the ARIMA model parameters to potentially improve forecasting accuracy.\n",
    "2. Experiment with different anomaly detection thresholds to balance sensitivity and specificity.\n",
    "3. Apply this method to real-world data and collaborate with domain experts to validate and interpret the results.\n",
    "4. Develop an automated alert system based on this anomaly detection method for real-time monitoring.\n",
    "5. Investigate machine learning-based anomaly detection methods (e.g., isolation forests, autoencoders) and compare their performance with this ARIMA-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we can further refine our anomaly detection system and provide valuable insights for business decision-making and process optimization."
